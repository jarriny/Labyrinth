Subject: Questions about the Game
 

We have chosen the three most important questions that we think the description leaves open. 

Our first question is, Are the rows and columns that are movable chosen randomly, and how do they correspond as the size of the board changes?

Our second question is, Is there a specific number of each tile shape and gem for every instance played?

Our third question is, Are there any restrictions on where a player's goal tile can be depending on the location of their home tile?
